# Why use **`R`**?

.pull-left[
## **`R`** is:

- **powerful**

- **reproducible**

- **free** (*libre* and *gratis*)

- **widely used** and **cross-platform**

- **actively** and **openly** developed

- **awesome!**
]

.pull-right[

]

---

# But **`R`** is intimidating!

--

.pull-left[
## Don't worry!

- Lots of good tools and resources

- You don't have to be an expert to use **`R`** effectively

- **`R`** grows with you!

# Getting Started

---

# Getting **`R`**

The main **`R`** website is [www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org).

--

**`R`** and over 10,000 contributed **`R`** packages are available from **CRAN** 
(the **C**omprehensive **`R`** **A**rchive **N**etwork).

Download and install **`R`** for your operating system at **CRAN**:  
[cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org)

![CRAN](./im/CRAN.png)

---

# Tip \#1: Use **RStudio**

**RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for **`R`**.

.center[
![RStudio](./im/RStudio.png)
]

--

Basically, **RStudio** is a **free** program completely dedicated to making **`R`** 
easier to use.

--

The main **RStudio** website is [www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com).

Download and install **RStudio** for your operating system here:  
[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

---

# Tip \#1: Use **RStudio**

## Do not open **`R`**!

## Open **RStudio** instead!

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

## The **`R`** Console

**`R`** is fundamentally a text-based program.

![R Console](./im/console.png)

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

## The **`R`** Console

You can type commands directly at the prompt: **`&gt;`**

Press `Enter`, and **`R`** will execute the command and return any output.

--

```r
&gt; 1 + 1
```

`[1] 2`

--

`1 + 1` is the command entered.

`[1] 2` is the output. `[1]` means we're looking at the first element of the 
output. `2` is the result of the calculation.

--

After the command is finished running, you are returned to a new prompt: **`&gt;`**

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

**`R`** has many built-in commands (called **functions**).

--


```r
date()
```

```
## [1] "Wed Mar 29 18:13:00 2017"
```

--

&lt;br /&gt;

**`#`** is the **comment** symbol. **`R`** will ignore anything on a line after
`#`.

I will leave off the prompt **`&gt;`** for **`R`** commands and comment **`##`** 
the output to make code easier to copy and paste into your own console from this 
presentation.

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

Things inside function calls are called **arguments**.


```r
round(3.141593)
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```r
round(3.141593, digits = 2)
```

```
## [1] 3.14
```

```r
round(pi, 2)
```

```
## [1] 3.14
```

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics: Help!

To find out about a function in **`R`**, use the built-in help:

```r
?name
```

OR

```r
help(name)
```

--

Use

```r
??keyword
```

to search the built-in help.

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics: Help!

```r
?round
```

![Help](./im/help.png)
]

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

## Everything that happens in **`R`** is a function call

## Everything that exists in **`R`** is an object

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

**`R`** objects can be stored with **`&lt;-`**

--

**`&lt;-`** is the *assignment operator*


```r
a &lt;- 6
b &lt;- 1:5
```

--


```r
a
```

```
## [1] 6
```

```r
b
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5
```

--

Use **`Alt+-`** (`Option+-`) to insert `&lt;-` (surrounded by spaces) in RStudio.

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

Try to use helpful and consistent names for the objects you create.

--

&lt;br /&gt;

&gt; Variable and function names should be lowercase. Use an underscore (`_`) to 
&gt; separate words within a name... Generally, variable names should be nouns and 
&gt; function names should be verbs. Strive for names that are concise and 
&gt; meaningful (this is not easy!).

&lt;br /&gt;

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

**Vectors** are ordered groups of objects of the same data type. You can make 
vectors using **`c()`**.


```r
numeric_vector &lt;- c(0.5, 0.6)
logical_vector &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE)
character_vector &lt;- c("a", "b", "cde", "f")
integer_vector &lt;- 2:8
integer_vector_2 &lt;- c(3L, 5L, 4L, 56L)
```

--

Examine the structure of an object using **`str()`**:


```r
str(integer_vector)
```

```
##  int [1:7] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

You can even store your own functions in objects!


```r
add_two_numbers &lt;- function(x, y) {
    result &lt;- x + y
    result
}
```

--


```r
add_two_numbers(4, 6)
```

```
## [1] 10
```

--


```r
addition_result &lt;- add_two_numbers(12, 436)
print(addition_result)
```

```
## [1] 448
```


---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

Keep track of objects you have stored in the environment pane:

&lt;br /&gt;

![Environment](./im/environment.png)
]

---

# Tip \#2: Don't Type at the Console

## Use **`R`** Scripts!

--

**`R`** scripts are plain text files (usually with the extension `.R`) in which 
you can save **`R`** code.

--

**`R`** scripts:

- make it easy to edit and re-run your code

--

- keep a reproducible record of your work

--

Start with a clean workspace at the beginning of each session.

You can easily pick up where you left off by using an **`R`** script!

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics: Scripts

In RStudio, `File &gt; New File &gt; R Script` will open a new file in the Source 
Editor pane:

.center[
![Source Editor](./im/source.png)
]

--

**`Ctrl+Enter`** (`Cmd+Enter`) to run the current line/selection

# Tip \#3: Use Awesome **`R`** Packages!

There are over 10,000 user-contributed packages on CRAN (and many more elsewhere).

--

Base **`R`** is great, but some of the syntax has a pretty steep learning curve. 
Many packages are designed to make **`R`** easier to use.

- Especially those created by Hadley Wickham and the people at RStudio.

--

**`R`** has a built-in way to install packages. This will install a fairly large 
set of awesome packages designed to work well together to make your life easier:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown"))
```

--

If you want to start with a smaller subset of those packages:

```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "readr", "ggplot2"))
```

---

# Load Packages for Use

To use packages you have installed, use **`library()`**:

--


```r
library(tidyverse)
```

```
## Loading tidyverse: ggplot2
## Loading tidyverse: tibble
## Loading tidyverse: tidyr
## Loading tidyverse: readr
## Loading tidyverse: purrr
## Loading tidyverse: dplyr
```

```
## Conflicts with tidy packages ----------------------------------------------
```

```
## filter(): dplyr, stats
## lag():    dplyr, stats
```

--

Packages only need to be installed once, but they need to be loaded each session.

--

**`package::function()`** lets you be explicit about where a function comes from.


---

# Tip \#4: Use **`ggplot2`** for Graphics

**`ggplot2`** is a graphics package by Hadley Wickham which implements the 
**grammar of graphics**.
