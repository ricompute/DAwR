# Getting Started

---

# Getting **`R`**

The main **`R`** website is [www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org).

--

**`R`** and over 10,000 contributed **`R`** packages are available from **CRAN** 
(the **C**omprehensive **`R`** **A**rchive **N**etwork).

Download and install **`R`** for your operating system at **CRAN**:  
[cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org)

![CRAN](./im/CRAN.png)

---

# Tip \#1: Use **RStudio**

**RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for **`R`**.

.center[
![RStudio](./im/RStudio.png)
]

--

Basically, **RStudio** is a **free** program completely dedicated to making **`R`** 
easier to use.

--

The main **RStudio** website is [www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com).

Download and install **RStudio** for your operating system here:  
[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

## The **`R`** Console

**`R`** is fundamentally a text-based program.

![R Console](./im/console.png)

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

## The **`R`** Console

You can type commands directly at the prompt: **`>`**

Press `Enter`, and **`R`** will execute the command and return any output.

--

```r
> 1 + 1
```

`[1] 2`

--

`1 + 1` is the command entered.

`[1] 2` is the output. `[1]` means we're looking at the first element of the 
output. `2` is the result of the calculation.

--

After the command is finished running, you are returned to a new prompt: **`>`**

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

**`R`** has many built-in commands (called **functions**).

--

```{r}
date()
```

--

<br />

**`#`** is the **comment** symbol. **`R`** will ignore anything on a line after
`#`.

I will leave off the prompt **`>`** for **`R`** commands and comment **`##`** 
the output to make code easier to copy and paste into your own console from this 
presentation.

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

Things inside function calls are called **arguments**.

```{r}
round(3.141593)
round(3.141593, digits = 2)
round(pi, 2)
```

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics: Help!

To find out about a function in **`R`**, use the built-in help:

```r
?name
```

OR

```r
help(name)
```

--

Use

```r
??keyword
```

to search the built-in help.

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics: Help!

```r
?round
```

![Help](./im/help.png)

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

## Everything that happens in **`R`** is a function call

## Everything that exists in **`R`** is an object

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

**`R`** objects can be stored with **`<-`**

--

**`<-`** is the *assignment operator*

```{r}
a <- 6
b <- 1:5
```

--

```{r}
a
b
```

--

Use **`Alt+-`** (`Option+-`) to insert `<-` (surrounded by spaces) in RStudio.

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

Try to use helpful and consistent names for the objects you create.

--

<br />

> Variable and function names should be lowercase. Use an underscore (`_`) to 
> separate words within a name... Generally, variable names should be nouns and 
> function names should be verbs. Strive for names that are concise and 
> meaningful (this is not easy!).

<br />

&mdash; Hadley Wickham, [*R Packages*](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html#style) ([r-pkgs.had.co.nz](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz))

--

<br />

**Warning**: **`R`** is case-sensitive.  
`Hello_world` is not the same as `hello_world`.

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

**Vectors** are ordered groups of objects of the same data type. You can make 
vectors using **`c()`**.

```{r}
numeric_vector <- c(0.5, 0.6)
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "cde", "f")
integer_vector <- 2:8
integer_vector_2 <- c(3L, 5L, 4L, 56L)
```

--

Examine the structure of an object using **`str()`**:

```{r}
str(integer_vector)
```

--

Get specific elements of a vector using **`[ ]`**:

```{r}
character_vector[3]
```


---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

You can even store your own functions in objects!

```{r}
add_two_numbers <- function(x, y) {
    result <- x + y
    result
}
```

--

```{r}
add_two_numbers(4, 6)
```

--

```{r}
addition_result <- add_two_numbers(12, 436)
print(addition_result)
```


---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics

Keep track of objects you have stored in the environment pane:

<br />

.center[
![Environment](./im/environment.png)
]

---

# Tip \#2: Don't Type at the Console

## Use **`R`** Scripts!

--

**`R`** scripts are plain text files (usually with the extension `.R`) in which 
you can save **`R`** code.

--

**`R`** scripts:

- make it easy to edit and re-run your code

--

- keep a reproducible record of your work

--

Start with a clean workspace at the beginning of each session.

You can easily pick up where you left off by using an **`R`** script!

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics: Scripts

In RStudio, `File > New File > R Script` will open a new file in the Source 
Editor pane:

.center[
![Source Editor](./im/source.png)
]

--

**`Ctrl+Enter`** (`Cmd+Enter`) to run the current line/selection.

**`source("filename.R")`** to run the whole file.

---

# **`R`** and **RStudio** Basics: Scripts

**Code with style.**

--

Write code which is meant to be read, even if it is only for you.

--

Follow Hadley Wickham's [code style guidelines](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html#style).

--

- Except indent 4 spaces.

--

- Unless you don't want to. Just be consistent.

--

Basically, use spaces and punctuation like you normally would in English:

```r
# This function does a thing to the data to prepare it for plotting
do_a_thing <- function(arg_1, arg_2) {
    indented_function_body  # This is how it works
}
```

--

**NOT**

--

```r
thg<-function(a1,a2){fnbdy}
```

---

# Tip \#2.5: Use RStudio Projects

--

Create a new project for (stay with me here) each project you work on.

--

`File > New Project`

--

This creates a folder for your project and automatically changes your working 
directory to be in that folder. Keep all files associated with the project in 
this folder.

--

Much confusion is eliminated, as is the need to use `setwd()`.

--

Using RStudio projects in combination with doing all your work in **`R`** scripts 
means you do not need to save your workspace image to `.RData`. In general, 
it is better to start each session with a clean workspace and recreate your work 
via R scripts.

# Add Awesome to Your **`R`**

---

# Tip \#3: Use Awesome **`R`** Packages!

There are over 10,000 user-contributed packages on CRAN (and many more elsewhere).

--

Base **`R`** is great, but some of the syntax has a pretty steep learning curve. 
Many packages are designed to make **`R`** easier to use.

- Especially those created by Hadley Wickham and the people at RStudio.

--

**`R`** has a built-in way to install packages. This will install a fairly large 
set of awesome packages designed to work well together to make your life easier:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown"))
```

--

If you want to start with a smaller subset of those packages:

```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "readr", "ggplot2"))
```

---

# Load Packages for Use

To use packages you have installed, use **`library()`**:

--

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

--

Packages only need to be installed once, but they need to be loaded each session.

--

**`package::function()`** lets you be explicit about where a function comes from.

# Make Pretty Pictures

---

# Tip \#4: Use **`ggplot2`** for Graphics

**`ggplot2`** is a graphics package by Hadley Wickham which implements the 
**grammar of graphics** to give you an accessible mental model for thinking about 
graphics and allow you to easily and rapidly create new graphics.

--

Example data: `ggplot2::mpg`

```{r}
str(mpg)
```

---

# Data in Data Frames

"A **data frame** is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and 
observations (in the rows)." 
([*R4DS*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#first-steps))

--

```{r}
mpg
```

---

# Data in Data Frames

Access a column of a data frame with **`$`**:

```{r}
mpg$displ
```

---

# Plotting with **`ggplot2`**

Create a coordinate system with `ggplot()`, and add layers with **`+`**:

```{r mpg_example, dev = 'svg', fig.align = "center", fig.width = 9, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, 
                             size = cty, color = class))
```

---

# Add Facets

```{r mpg_example_2, dev = 'svg', fig.align = "center", fig.width = 9, fig.height = 4.7}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
    facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

# Tidy Your Data

# Tip \#5: Use Tidy Data

> Write code for humans, write data for computers.
> &mdash; [Vince Buffalo](https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo/statuses/358699162679787521)

--

**Tidy data** is an organizing principle which you can use to structure your data 
to make it easier to work with in **`R`**.

--

[Tidy data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) means:

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

![Tidy Data](./im/tidy-1.png)

# Tidy Data

Practically, this means **data frames** should be the fundamental way your data 
exist in **`R`**.

--

```{r}
untidy_data <- dplyr::data_frame(Treatment = c("Control", "T3"),
                                 Day1 = c(4.5, 8.7),
                                 Day3 = c(5.4, 9.9))
untidy_data
```
